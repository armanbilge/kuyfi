TimeZone database parser in Scala

This is a small scala based project that can parse the contents of the [TimeZone database](https://www.iana.org/time-zones).
It can be used on time-related libraries like [scala-java-time](https://github.com/soc/scala-java-time)

Check the [documentation](https://cquiroz.github.io/kuyfi)
